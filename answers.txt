Murderer: Ashley
Ashley killed Mike on Tuesday, but she does not want others know. So she went back to Mike's house on Wednesday to prepare the ingredients on Wednesday and saw the postman when she leave. When she was cooking on Thursday, she found the vegetables are not fresh. So she still made it but threw it away after she finished the dish.
