<h2>A Generous Friend</h2>
<div class="time"></div>
<div class="storydiv">Everyone in this neighborhood knows Mike. When Sunday comes, he always invites his other 4 friends to share dinner with him. 
To prepare for this dinner, Mike needs to go shopping several days ahead and keep the foods in the fridge, but he is still happy with this. 
On the March, 10th, a usual Sunday, Ashley, George, Jonathan, and Sarah is on their way to Mike's home. Without even opening the door, 
they can smell the delicious dishes. However, there is no one answering the doors when they are knocking. Thinking that's weird, 
they break the lock and enter the dining room. They saw Mike sitting at the table appearing to be frozen, as if he was petrified. The dishes are cold and are not edible anymore.
Shocked by this, they decide to figure it out who killed their friend Mike.</div>
